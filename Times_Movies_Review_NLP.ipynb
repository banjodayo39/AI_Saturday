       "[<div class=\"section1\"><div class=\"Normal\"><strong>STORY:</strong> Soon after she is born, Aisha is diagnosed with SCID, a rare genetic disorder that is life threatening. Her parents, Aditi and Niren make it their life’s mission to do whatever it takes to make her survive for as long as possible.<br/><br/><br/><strong>REVIEW: </strong>Based on a true story, ‘The Sky is Pink’ touches an emotional chord from the word go. As Aisha’s (Zaira Wasim) lively voiceover takes over from the start of the film, we are drawn into Aditi (Priyanka Chopra) and Niren’s (Farhan Akhtar) life instantly. A life that turns upside down almost right after Aisha’s birth. It is heart-wrenching to watch Aditi and Niren stay determined, hopeful and keep their spirits intact as they go through a grueling time as a middle-class couple trying to raise funds for their child’s treatment in London. <br/><br/>Aditi at one point lives alone in London for months, for Aisha’s treatment while Niren goes back to Delhi to work and be with their other child, Ishaan. The one phone call, where Ishaan tells his mom who is away, that he was scolded in class for coloring the sky pink and Aditi assuring him that the sky can be any color he wants it to, will move you to tears. And there are many such tender moments in the film that linger on. <br/><br/>However ‘The Sky is Pink’ not your typical tear jerking ride. The narrative and dialogues in film do a good balancing act of keeping some tough emotional scenes light-hearted, with a quirky touch. Aditi and Niren’s love story add some genuine fun moments and so does their overall chemistry as a couple, which is ultimately the soul of the film. And the sensitively dealt with moments add their heft to the emotional ride that the family goes through together. But as different aspects of Aisha, Aditi and Niren’s lives find their way into the narrative, the pace slackens, making it a lengthy watch. In fact, one wishes the screenplay was more focused and some portions given more breathing time and delved into deeper. <br/><br/>However, the emotional arc and the stellar performances will keep you invested. Priyanka Chopra is remarkable as Aditi, a mom determined to the point of being obsessed with making her child live life to the fullest. Her grief and pain is palpable in every scene as her character graph spans across two decades. Farhan Akhtar as Niren, also pulls off a commendable performance as the supportive husband and the father whose emotions are not always on display, but is chipping away nonetheless. There is an amazing restraint in his act. Zaira Wasim breathes life into every moment she is on screen, with her vibrant energy adding the much needed poignant touch to her character. <br/><br/>‘The Sky is Pink’ is definitely a stirring watch as your heart goes out to the Chaudhary family and their zest for making every moment count, despite the trying times they go through. This one scores high on the emotional quotient. <br/><br/><br/></div></div>]"
